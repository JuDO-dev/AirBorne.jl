# Example: Building Strategies for DEDS & Static Markets
In this page you will find examples on the creation of strategies.

### [Building a Simple Moving Average Strategy](https://github.com/JuDO-dev/AirBorne.jl/blob/markowitz/docs/example_notebooks/SMA_Example.ipynb).
This example will show you how to build a simple moving average strategy for a **Static Market** using the **Discrete Event Driven Simulation** (DEDS) egine as well as an introduction to the template provided by [AirBorne.jl](https://github.com/JuDO-dev/AirBorne.jl). 

The full example can be found in the [AirBorne.jl](https://github.com/JuDO-dev/AirBorne.jl) repository in the form of a Jupyter Notebook following [this link](https://github.com/JuDO-dev/AirBorne.jl/blob/markowitz/docs/example_notebooks/SMA_Example.ipynb).
