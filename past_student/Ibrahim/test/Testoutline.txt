Data Parsing
Test each parsing function (CSV_Parsing, Excel_Parsing, JSON_Parsing, SQLite_Parsing, PostgreSQL_Parsing) with valid input files of various sizes and ensure the output matches the expected result.
Test each parsing function with empty or invalid files and ensure that it handles these gracefully (e.g., by throwing a meaningful error message).
Test each parsing function with files containing data of unexpected types or formats and ensure it handles these correctly.
Test initial_portfolio_details function with different combinations of parsing method and arguments to ensure compatibility.
Test parse_input with invalid arguments or data structures to check if it throws an appropriate error.

Constraints and Data Filtering
Test apply_constraints with a dataset and several constraints to ensure it correctly filters the data.
Test apply_constraints with an empty dataset and ensure it returns an empty result.
Test apply_constraints with no constraints and ensure it returns the same dataset.
Test apply_constraints with constraints that match no data items and ensure it returns an empty dataset.
Test get_feature with various datums and features to ensure it correctly extracts the feature values.
Test get_feature with invalid datum or non-existing feature and ensure it throws an appropriate error.

Data Fetching and Matching
Test each get_tradable_securities and get_financial_securities function with valid platform credentials and indexing function and ensure they return correct data.
Test each function with invalid platform credentials and ensure they handle the error gracefully.
Test each function with an invalid or non-existing indexing function and ensure they throw an appropriate error.
Test get_universe_securities_dispatch with valid arguments and ensure it returns correct results.
Test get_universe_securities_dispatch with mismatched tickers in tradable and financial securities, and check if it correctly identifies the common and unique tickers.

Portfolio Constraints
Test add_constraint function by adding a constraint to a PortfolioConstraints instance and ensuring the new constraint is added.
Test check_portfolio with a portfolio that satisfies all constraints and ensure it returns true.
Test check_portfolio with a portfolio that violates at least one constraint and ensure it returns false.
Test check_portfolio with an empty portfolio and ensure it handles it correctly (based on your requirements)
