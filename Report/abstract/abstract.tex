 \noindent Investing is perhaps one of the most lucrative ways of making money and although there are many different forms of investment the most well-known is investing in shares/equity on the stock market. Scientific methods and algorithms can provide an insight, serving as a tool for increasing the odds of being successful when trading in the stock market.The main aim of this project is to  facilitate fast, accurate and high-performance financial trading by implementation of a programming package named \textbf{AirBorne.jl}. A variety of prediction algorithms will be explored ranging from simple prediction techniques to more sophisticated approaches. In particular an approach surrounding behavioural control theory will be further investigated. The project also aims to evaluate the feasibility, robustness, and accuracy of any current and potential solutions for any financial stock analysis/prediction and trading.
